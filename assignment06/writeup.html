            <p>
                With the holidays right around the corner, I thought a great idea for this assignment was to make a winter-themed
                VR experience. There are several classes, one for snowman, snow, and tree. The tree is a bread-and-butter class
                consisting of a cylindrical trunk, and three cones for a tree shape. In order to implement the Snow class I had
                to do a little "cheat". Rendering thousands of snow particles is a bad idea performance wise, so instead, I only
                rendered a hundred snow particles. But, I made sure that these one hundred particles would always fall near the
                player, to give the illusion that it was actually snowing. The Snowman class used container3d as well as Perlin
                noise for movement. It also has a click behavior, when you click the top most block, the snowman get an additional
                block added on top of it (maximum 4 blocks total)!
