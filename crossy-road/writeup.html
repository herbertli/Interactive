            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>Ah-Up is a voice-controlled game inspired by other vertical platformers like Doodle Jump. In Ah-Up, you
                take control of rocket and use your voice to propel it upwards while grabbing coins and avoiding
                obstacles. You can play the game on the left (if you don't see it, make sure you're using HTTPS).
            </p>
            <h2>How to Play:</h2>
            <p>The controls are pretty simple. Click to move forward. With a VR headset, look around as
                you normally would, in the browser you can use click and hold to pan around the space.
            </p>
            <h2>Implementation Details:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Several classes for Cars, Logs, and Coins (checkCollision(), move(), display() methods)</li>
                <li>Several classes for generating the map, e.g. Fence, Road, River made laying out the map pretty easy
                    and makes it easy to extend the map
                </li>
                <li>Text display/manipulation done using jQuery</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Classes in Depth:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Car(opt)</li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>consists of upperbody (box), lowerbody (box), tires (torus + boxes for spokes), and light
                            (cone)
                        </li>
                        <li>opt's x y z will be the center point of the lowerBody's upper surface's center</li>
                        <li>opt's height and width and depth will be lowerBody's height and width and depth</li>
                        <li>initially, the tires were a bunch of cylinders, but due to performance issues, we toned them
                            down to boxes
                        </li>
                        <li>cars also honk if the user gets too close/if they're about to get hit</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Cloud(opt)</li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>opt's width will be the width (long part) of the cloud; height will be the height; x, y, z
                            will be the center
                        </li>
                        <li>randomly generated bunch of circles</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Coin(opt)</li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>opt's x and z are the coin's position</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Fence(x, z, width, numPosts, direction)</li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>x, z is the center of the fence, direction determines whether fence goes in the x or z
                            direction
                        </li>
                        <li>drawn using boxes</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Floor (Road, River, Grass)</li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Constructors take x, z, width, and depth (x, z are the center point)</li>
                        <li>Road takes an additional parameter: lanes</li>
                        <li>Road is drawn using an external asset image, which is just a one lane road</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Log(opt)</li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>opt's x y z will be the center point of the log</li>
                        <li>y should be 0 in most cases, to give the appearance of it being half submerged</li>
                        <li>opt's height, width, and depth will be log's actual height, width, and depth</li>
                        <li>opt should also have xSpeed, ySpeed, and zSpeed</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Implementation Details:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Collisions</li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Were mainly handled by checking whether the user (a point) was in some object</li>
                        <li>See our point-in-rectangle function/li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Log moving</li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Check whether user was on a log (collision detection)</li>
                        <li>If so, nudge the user based on the log's speed</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Timer</li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Frame rates are inconsistent across mobile and web</li>
                        <li>used p5 to keep track of the current second (system time), update the timer based on whether
                            the second
                            has changed
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Text</li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Used a-text and jQuery to hide, modify, and remove the text in the scene</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Resetting the User</li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Used setUserPosition(), but also had to use jQuery to reset the user's rotation</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Challenges:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Getting used to Aframe in general</li>
                <li>Drawing text in VR</li>
                <li>Handling log interactions (having the user drift with logs)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Moving Forward:</h2>
            <p>
                We initially wanted to include different game modes in the game.
                In the end, we ran out of time, however if we were given more time, we would've added
                an arcade/endless mode, where is goal is just to see how far you can go.
                This ends the high-level overview of our project, keep reading to see progress logs and
                more details of our implementation
