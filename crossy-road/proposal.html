            <p>
                For our final project, we'll be making a first-person version of crossy road in VR. The player
                will be able to walk in a virtual world. The objective of the game is to make it across to
                the other side, all the while avoiding cars passing by. In addition to roads, we also plan to have
                rivers. In order to cross rivers, the player will have to walk across logs floating by.
                Currently, the only game mode we have planned is one where the sole objective is to cross over, but
                time permitting, we would like to add an arcade version that goes on infinitely, or a version
                where the user has to collect the most coins!
